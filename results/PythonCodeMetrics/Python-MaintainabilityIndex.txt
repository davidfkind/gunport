Radon 4.1.0 (https://pypi.org/project/radon/)
The mi command
This command analyzes Python source code files and compute the Maintainability Index score. Every positional argument is treated as a starting point from which to walk looking for Python files (as in the cc command). Paths can be excluded with the -e option. The Maintainability Index is always in the range 0-100. MI is ranked as follows:

MI score	Rank	Maintainability
100 - 20	A	Very high
19 - 10		B	Medium
9 - 0		C	Extremely low

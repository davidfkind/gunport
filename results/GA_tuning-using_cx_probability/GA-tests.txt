###### TODO:
# - need to loop through to find as many solutions as possible and record the time taken.
# - Is the GA converging too soon?
# - Is there an optimal mutation rate; population size; cross-over rate; max generations?
#   - automatically run to tune itself; separate calling script?!
#   - can we test the separate cross-over methods as well?!

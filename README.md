# The Gunport Problem

## Abstract

The Gunport Problem is a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Geometric Optimisation
Problem, which has been the focus of several mathematical puzzle
publications. The problem can described in terms of Clumsy Packing Polyominoes,
in that it involves filling a 2 dimensional board with a minimum number
dominoes and leaving a maximum number holes to give the lowest possible
density. The problem is multi-modal and computationally expensive to solve.

The research critically assesses the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms
using a quantitative comparative experimental research design method and using
a Backtracking Algorithm as the control group. The Memetic Algorithm
proving to be the most efficient and an invaluable tool in understanding the
underlying geometric structures. It became apparent that higher dimensions
can be solved using a periodic symmetry from the lower dimensions. Generated
Integer Sequences highlight the shared similarities with the field of Monomer-
Dimer lattice coverings.
